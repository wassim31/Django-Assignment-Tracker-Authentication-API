# Django Assignment Tracker & Authentication API

This project is a full-featured Django REST API that implements secure user authentication and a real-time assignment tracking system. It was developed as part of a backend development assignment.

## üîê Authentication Features

- Built with Django's built-in authentication system and Django REST Framework's token-based authentication.
- Secure password hashing and storage using Django's default PBKDF2.
- Endpoints:
  - **User Registration** with OTP validation and email verification.
  - **Login** and **Logout** using token-based authentication.
  - **Password Reset** functionality with secure email-based reset flow.
- Full unit test coverage for all authentication-related endpoints.

## üìã Assignment Tracking

- A dedicated model to track assignments with the following fields:
  - `name`: assignment name
  - `description`: details about the assignment
  - `status`: one of `todo`, `in progress`, `done`, `error`
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: auto-managed timestamps
  - `assignee`: ForeignKey to the user
- REST API endpoints include:
  - Filtering, sorting, pagination, and search support.
  - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- All endpoints are protected with appropriate permissions.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database

- Powered by **PostgreSQL**, fully integrated with Django.
- Extended with **TimescaleDB** for time-series optimizations and performance tuning on timestamped assignment data.
- Demonstrates optimized queries for time-based operations.

## üß™ Testing

- Unit tests implemented for:
  - User registration, login, logout, password reset.
  - Assignment creation, update, deletion, and retrieval.
